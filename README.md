# Maxim DeJong's Project Portfolio
Here are the projects I've created or planned to create since before I started my formal studies in engineering at McGill, and I've also included some projects that don't pertain to engineering, but rather showcase my personal interests and artistic pursuits. Thanks for giving it a look!

If you care to reach out to me about anything, you can reach me by email at:
